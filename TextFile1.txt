TaxCalculator


1. Create a TaxCalculator class that automatically reads the CSV file on startup with no functions being invoked by Main().
	Special CTOR exposes static method: ComputeTaxFor that accepts two values; a state abbrevation and an income amount earned. The method should compute the tax due and return the tax as a decimal.

2. Check data file for formatting errors, print out why the parsing failed and ignore the line "Try and Except block"

3.TaxCalculator need a setting to allow silent or verbose mode
		silent mode will just return the tax
		verbose mode will explain in detail (using console.writeline)how the tax was computed.

4. Create a Main method to allow you to test the tax calculator.
		should be able to enter a state abbrevation and amount earned.
		test calculator in verbose mode.
